# Capstone_1

This project is intended for a small restaurant to utilize in order to keep track of their sales and foodcost. 

The api that is used is BlueCartApi and gets product pricing based off Walmart.

The user is able to create different menus and menu items. Under each menu item, they can add the ingredients that are used to create each item.

The user is able to input weekly sales forecasts and enter actual sales as the week progresses and get results.

The user is also able to input product that is purchased at Walmart for the restaurant. The purchase and sales data are combined in the end to generate a weekly inventory after the inventory count is completed.

They can track and view historic data for their operation.
